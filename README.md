# SpimiSearch
Running the Code

Before running this code on a different PC than my own, a few quick modifications must be made to the .py files to ensure that directories are properly set.
Within the .py files, at the top of the code, please edit the following lines to reflect the correct directories:
-	writePath: Path to the “articles” folder.
-	readPath: Path to the “reuters” folder.
-	blockPath: Path to the “blocks” folder.
To run the code, simply navigate to the folder containing the source code files (using the command prompt) and type “python ProcessReuters.py” to run the pre-processor, “python SPIMISearchEngine.py” to run the SPIMI indexer, or “python SearchMethods.py” to run searches using SHNOOGLE, my Reuters Search Engine.
